Deals
Your Local Life   provides consumers with opportunities to purchase products and services from third party merchants ("Merchants") with a time limited promotional added value (a "Deal"). Merchants are willing to offer attractive promotionals in order to reach the Your Local Life   community.

1. How It Works
By placing an order for a given Deal, you make an offer to purchase the Deal you have selected on the terms, restrictions and conditions associated with the Deal. Once you’ve placed your order, you will received a confirmation of the Deal and your credit card will be charged for the amount of the Deal. We will notify you by email when the Voucher (defined below) for the Deal is ready to be used. You are required to create an account in order to purchase any Deal. An account is required so we can collect information to allow you to pay for your Deals and provide you with easy access to print your Deals, view your past purchases, and modify your preferences.

2. The Voucher
Each Deal combines two separate portions that make up the Deal: (i) a paid portion equal to the amount your credit card is charged (the "paid portion"); and (ii) at no additional charge to you, a promotional portion for the balance of the value of the Deal if used by the promotional expiration date on the Voucher (the "promotional portion") (together, the paid and promotional portions of the Deal are presented in a "Voucher"). In the event you redeem your Voucher for less than the full amount stated on the Voucher, your purchase will be allocated first against the paid portion until it has a balance of zero dollars ($0.00) and then against the promotional portion that is remaining.

3. Expiration Dates
The expiration date for a Voucher is as printed on the Voucher.

If the expiration of the paid value of the Voucher as of the date printed on the Voucher is prohibited under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Merchant is located, then the Voucher shall expire as follows: the promotional portion of the Voucher will expire on the date printed on the Voucher, and the paid portion of the Voucher will expire five (5) years from the date the Voucher is issued, except to the extent applicable law requires that the Merchant extend the period in which the Voucher may be redeemed. The Merchant is obligated to honor the Voucher in compliance with law. If the Merchant refuses to honor the Voucher before the legally permitted expiration date, then Your Local Life   will refund the paid portion of your Voucher in the form of a credit for future Deals (what we currently call “deal bucks”). In order to receive the credit, you must provide the following information in writing to help@yourlocallife.com: (a) identification of the Voucher and Merchant with whom you sought to redeem the Voucher, (b) statement of the date, time, and circumstances in which the Merchant refused to redeem the Voucher, and (c) a statement, under penalty of perjury, that the Voucher has never been redeemed with the Merchant.

4. Deal Bucks
"Deal Bucks" are a form of Your Local Life   currency that may be applied as a credit towards future Your Local Life   purchases. There are three types of Deal Bucks - Paid Deal Bucks, which you may purchase in certain incremental values (either as gift bucks or otherwise), Earned Deal Bucks, which are awarded to you from time to time as loyalty rewards or as customer service deems appropriate, and Promotional Deal Bucks, which are given to certain customers in connection with a specific promotion, contest or sweepstakes. Promotional Deal Bucks expire in accordance with the terms of the particular promotion. Paid and Earned Deal Bucks expire five years after the date of purchase or issuance, except where expiration of Paid Deal Bucks is prohibited by law. Paid Deal Bucks will be applied toward future Your Local Life   purchases before Earned Deal Bucks, even if the Earned Deal Bucks expire first. Promotional Deal Bucks however will always be applied first due to their short term. Additionally, all Deal Bucks may only be applied towards purchases that are in the same currency as the Earned, Paid or Promotional Deal Bucks. Deal Bucks are not returnable or refundable for cash, except where required by law. Resale of Deal Bucks is strictly prohibited.

5. Deal Specific Terms
Each Deal has specific terms associated with the Deal, which will be presented to you at the time you commit to purchase the particular Deal. Deal specific terms supersede any inconsistent terms in this Agreement, except to the extent such terms are prohibited by applicable law.

6. Global Terms
Unless otherwise stated in the Voucher or required by law, the following additional terms apply to all Vouchers:

•no cash value for any Voucher,
•no cash back will be issued for partial redemption of the paid portion of a Voucher, except as required by law,
•no cash back or credit will be issued for partial redemption of the promotional portion of a Voucher,
•use of a Voucher for alcoholic beverages is at the sole discretion of the Merchant (which may be limited by applicable state or provincial law), unless otherwise noted on the Voucher,
•Vouchers cannot be combined with any other coupons or promotions unless otherwise noted in the Voucher,
•Vouchers cannot be used for taxes, tips, prior balances, shipping or handling, as applicable,
•neither Your Local Life   nor the Merchant is responsible for lost or stolen Vouchers or Voucher reference numbers,
•duplicate use, sale or trade of a Voucher is prohibited, except as required by law,
•unless otherwise stated at the time a Voucher is purchased, the Voucher price does not include sales, value added or use taxes, which may be charged to you separately by the Merchant at the time you redeem the Voucher.
7. Merchant Responsibility
To be clear, Your Local Life   markets the Deals and acts an as agent in selling the Vouchers on behalf of the Merchants. But the Merchant is the issuer of the Voucher. As issuer of the Voucher, the Merchant shall be fully responsible for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs suffered by or in respect of a customer, caused in whole or in part by the Merchant or its products and services, as well as for any unclaimed property liability arising from unredeemed or partially redeemed Vouchers. By purchasing a Deal, a customer acquires the right to print a Voucher issued by the participating Merchant and to use the Voucher according to its terms and the terms of this Agreement. Whether you choose to print and/or redeem the Voucher is within your sole control and at your sole discretion.

8. Promotions of the Deal Program
From time to time we may offer special promotions, contests and/or sweepstakes intended to provide you an incentive to purchase Deals or to encourage you to get others to do so. The applicable rules will be posted on the Site in or near the description of each such promotion. We reserve the right to interpret these rules in our sole discretion, and you hereby agree to our interpretation.

9. Products Available for Sale
The Site can be accessed from countries around the world. You understand that some or all products or services provided on the Site may not be available for purchase to persons residing in certain jurisdictions or geographic areas. Your Local Life   reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to exclude or otherwise limit the provision of a Voucher for any product or service to a person residing in any jurisdiction or geographical area. Your Local Life   does not represent or warrant that any product or service promoted on the Site will be available for purchase by any particular person.

10. Refunds
Your Local Life   will provide a refund of the purchase price paid by you for any Deal within five days after the purchase of a Voucher, provided that the Voucher has not yet been redeemed. After five days, we do not provide refunds except that we will provide a refund if you are unable to redeem a Voucher before the applicable expiration of the Voucher because the relevant Merchant has gone out of business.

11. Playing Nicely
Some of the Deals are provided for a limited number of purchasers or a limited number of purchases, as specified for the particular Deal. Any attempt by a purchaser to obtain more than the permitted number of Vouchers specified for a particular Deal by using multiple or different identities, credit cards, forms, registrations, addresses or any other method will void that person's purchases. Your Local Life   will be the arbiter, in its discretion, as to whether purchase characteristics indicate a violation of these rules.

Termination
We may change or discontinue the Site or any of the Services at any time without prior notice. We reserve the right to terminate this Agreement at our election and for any reason, without prior notice, and this Agreement will automatically terminate in the event that you violate any of the terms and conditions set forth below. In the event of any termination, you will immediately cease access to the Site and Services. Any Voucher issued prior to termination will be honored according to its terms and the terms of this Agreement specifically applicable to such Voucher.
